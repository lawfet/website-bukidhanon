                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Mount Kitanglad, standing proudly at 2,899 meters above sea level, is one of the most significant natural treasures in the Philippines. As the centerpiece of the Kitanglad Mountain Range Natural Park, this mountain has earned recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and serves as a critical sanctuary for some of the country's most endangered species.</p>
                    
                    <p>The mountain's name means "to appear" or "to become visible" in the local language, referring to how the peak often emerges from clouds and mist, revealing its majestic presence to those below. Kitanglad is not just a geographical landmark but a living testament to the importance of conservation and the rich biodiversity that makes the Philippines one of the world's megadiverse countries.</p>
                    
                    <h2>UNESCO World Heritage Status</h2>
